Project Description:This project is a realistic off-road simulation game built with TypeScript and Three.js, focused on providing an authentic 4x4 driving experience. The game will simulate the physics and mechanics of real off-road vehicles, including drivetrain options and terrain interaction.

Core Features:

Realistic Vehicle Simulation: Support for selectable drivetrain modes, including:

4x2 (RWD/FWD)

4x4 High Range

4x4 Low Range

Center Differential Lock

Rear Differential Lock

Front Differential Lock

Physics-Based Terrain Interaction: Implement realistic traction, suspension dynamics, and terrain deformation where applicable.

Challenging Terrain: Design terrains with:

Mud, snow, sand, and rock crawling sections.

Dynamic surface friction that varies depending on conditions.

Water crossings with depth-based resistance and vehicle impact.

Vehicle Customization: Allow modifications such as tire types, suspension tuning, and drivetrain modifications.

Three.js & WebGL Graphics: Optimize for realistic lighting, materials, and shading to enhance the immersive experience.

Multiplayer & Leaderboards (Stretch Goal): Option for cooperative or competitive off-road challenges.

Technical Considerations:

Physics Engine: Consider integrating Ammo.js or Cannon.js for realistic vehicle physics.

Terrain Generation: Procedural terrain generation for dynamic maps.

Performance Optimization: Efficient rendering techniques to maintain smooth frame rates.

This game aims to be both a fun and technically impressive experience, leveraging the best of TypeScript and Three.js for an engaging off-road adventure.
